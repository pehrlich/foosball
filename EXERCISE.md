# Foosball Exercise

Frontend Development Workday

## Problem

We love foosball here at Mesosphere! We currently have one foosball table that lives on the third floor of our office. Foosball players are quite competitive and would like to know how they rank against their peers. At any time of the day, you’re likely to find two or more players at the table. People are always bragging about how good they are at Foosball, but we have no record of games.

## Exercise 1 (1h 30m)

We’re providing you with an HTML/CSS prototype of what we want the application to look like. Your task will be to add interactivity to the leaderboard. With this interactivity a player would be able to select any player on the leaderboard to view their recent matches on the right pane.

You will find the prototype here: [https://github.com/mesosphere/foosball](https://github.com/mesosphere/foosball)

##### Deliverables:

- The Leaderboard list entries should have a hover state when using mouse or keyboard
- There should be a selected state when using mouse or keyboard
    - See mock: [http://bit.ly/1BRyHOh](http://bit.ly/1BRyHOh)  
- Allow users to select a player from the leaderboard.
- Selecting a player from the leaderboard displays all of the selected player's matches.

##### Considerations:

- Navigation can be done with keyboard or mouse
- Think about how the keyboard navigation will work
- Consider additional functionality like selecting multiple players and unselecting

##### Review:

- You will be given 30 minutes to present your solution to the team
- Expect questions about the details of your implementation

## Exercise 2 (30m)

You will be reviewing a PR for a feature that another engineer will be submitting. You will be expected to do a detailed review of the PR.

##### Considerations:

- Think of code quality
- Consider having good arguments for requested changes
- Be diligent
- Make sure that the PR covers the Acceptance Criteria
- Nitpick if you feel the need to

##### Deliverables and Review:

- Your comments on the PR will be sufficient
