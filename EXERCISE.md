# Foosball Exercise

Frontend Development Workday

## Problem

We love foosball here at Mesosphere! We currently have one foosball table that lives on the third floor of our office. Foosball players are quite competitive and would like to know how they rank against their peers. At any time of the day, you’re likely to find two or more players at the table.  People are always bragging about how good they are at Foosball, but we have no record of games.

## Exercise 1 (1h 30m)

We’re providing you with an HTML/CSS prototype of what we want the application to look like. Your task will be to add interactivity to the leaderboard. With this

interactivity a player would be able to select any player on the leaderboard to view their recent matches on the right pane.

You will find the prototype here: [https://github.com/mesosphere/foosball](https://github.com/mesosphere/foosball)  

##### Deliverables:

- The Leaderboard list entries should have a hover state when using mouse or keyboard
- There should be a selected state when using mouse or keyboard
    - See mock: [http://bit.ly/1BRyHOh](http://bit.ly/1BRyHOh)  

- Set up the functionality to select a player from the leaderboard. For the sake of simplicity, show an alert or log to console when a selection occurs either via keyboard (Enter key) or mouse click.

##### Considerations:

- Navigation can be done with keyboard or mouse
- Think about how the keyboard navigation will work
- Consider additional functionality like selecting multiple players and unselecting

##### Review:

- Submit a PR to the repository
- The team will review your code and comment on the PR
- We will then review the comments together in a session
- Expect development centric questions
- Discuss next steps and future “wants/needs” for the app

## Exercise 2 (30m)

You will be reviewing a PR for a feature that another engineer will be submitting. You will be expected to do a detailed review of the PR.

##### Considerations:

- Think of code quality
- Consider having good arguments for requested changes
- Be diligent
- Make sure that the PR covers the Acceptance Criteria
- Nitpick if you need

##### Deliverables and Review:

- Your comments on the PR will be sufficient
